The turntable backgrounds can be found here <https://coastalpaleo.blogspot.com/2020/06/photogrammetry-turntable-backgrounds.html>

However, oddly - the tweet announcing their availability has larger and higher quality versions of the scale - <https://twitter.com/coastalpaleo/status/1276528937879904258>

The blogspot images are 2048x2041 JPEGs (with all the usual artifacts) while the images on Twitter are 3564x3552 PNGs (without those artifacts).
